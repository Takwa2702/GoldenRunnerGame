[Unity] Golden Runner, Awesome 3D Platformer Game.

## Description
The game takes place in a forest with a mysterious city, which is guarded by cops who are on the lookout for something unusual. Erika (our main character) plans to reach the city to retrieve the golden coins, as well as locate the abandoned house containing the Treasure chest which contains more golden bars. On the top left of the game, you'll see "Coin Score" to see how many you have achieved. While the player tries to attack the city, He/She needs to avoid the obstacles and not to get lost in the forest so they could reach the treasure.
